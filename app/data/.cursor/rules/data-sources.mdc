# Data Sources & Implementation Status

## Currently Implemented (Live Data)
- **Hacker News** (front page) â†’ "Quick Hits" tech/AI headlines (âœ… LIVE)
  - Note: Hacker News items don't have descriptions, so AI generates sensible placeholder descriptions
- **Tavily Search** â†’ Creative, random fun facts and niche content (âœ… LIVE)
  - Uses multiple diverse, creative search queries for surprising content
  - Avoids generic topics in favor of obscure, interesting, and weird facts
  - Searches for 2-3 completely different random topics per digest

## Planned for Future Implementation
